Danger/Emergency Alert System

This app uses the Google maps API and reverse geocoding to convert the geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. Through this app, the user can easily send its current location to its beloved ones or to some emergency number like 100 in case of some emergency or any dangerous situation. The user just needs to shake his/her phone or tap a single button to trigger the alert message to the concerned person or authority like Police. The user can also call the concerned person or any authority (like Police) through the app directly with just a single tap of the button.
